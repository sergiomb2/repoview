ABOUT:
------
This is a small software written to parse yum repositories and present them in a
format that's easily browsable via http by creating a set of static HTML pages.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
* Kid templating engine (0.6.3 or above)
* Yum 2.3 or above. If you don't have yum, or can't easily install that version of yum
  on your machine, get a copy of yum-2.4.x (http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/), 
  and do the following:
  - create a directory called "noyum" either in the subdirectory of this program
    or in /usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages.
  - from the yum tree, copy the files yum/comps.py, yum/mdparser.py,
    repomd/mdErrors.py, repomd/repoMDObject.py into the noyum directory
  - in the noyum directory, run "touch __init__.py"
  You will need to make sure you install python-elementtree.
