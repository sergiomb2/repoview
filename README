repoview [-i name] [-x arch] [-k dir] [-t] [-f] [-q] [repodir]
    This will make your repository browseable
    -i name
        Optionally ignore this package -- can be a shell-style glob.
        This is useful for excluding debuginfo packages:
        -i *debuginfo* -i *doc*
        The globbing will be done against name-epoch-version-release, 
        e.g. foo-0-1.0-1
    -x arch
        Optionally exclude this arch. E.g.:
        -x src -x ia64
    -k templatedir
        Use an alternative directory with kid templates instead of
        the default: ./templates
        The template directory must contain three required template 
        files: index.kid, group.kid, package.kid and the
        "layout" dir which will be copied into the repoview directory.
    -t
        Place the index.html into the top level of the repodir, instead of 
        just in repodata/index.html.
    -f
        Regenerate the pages even if the repomd checksum hasn't changed.
    -q
        Do not output anything except fatal erros.
    repodir
        Where to look for the 'repodata' directory.
