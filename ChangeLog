Version 0.5:
	* Switch to optparse. This may break older Pythons, not sure.
	* Dropped "-t toplevel" switch, since it complicated the code
	  a lot and not used by anyone, to my knowledge.
	* Moved "-l title" to "-t title" with a deprecation note in place.
	* Added RSS generation routines. Template for the entries is in
	  kid.rss. Feed published into repodata/latest-feed.xml. To enable
	  rss feed generation, pass a "-u URL" flag (repoview has no other way
	  of knowing where your data will be published).

Version 0.4.1
	* Add -V, --version, -h, and -? command-line options 
	  (#504, patch by Ville Skyttä)
	* Fix Changelog sorting (introduced in 0.4 with parser logic change)

Version 0.4
	* Add DOCTYPE declarations (#482)
	* Use YUM parsing routines with "noyum" fallback for people with no yum
	  or yum <= 2.3 (see README)
	* Fix the "latest packages" selection behaviour (#485, rh#168125)
	* Remove the (fairly useless) "Total Groups" summary
	* CSS Fixes from Ville Skyttä (#483, #484)
	* Add timestamps to the index page "Latest Packages" listing (#501)
	* Preserve unchanged files for more efficient mirroring (#492)

Version 0.3
	* Fall back to silly RPM groups if no group data is found.
	* Replace all slashes and spaces in group names to avoid breakage.
	* Add a -l switch to provide a brief title, e.g.:
	  -l "Fedora Extras 3 x86"

Version 0.2
    * Use iterparse to save a whole lotta memory
    * Work with kid-0.6
    * Do not use enumerate() as that breaks on python-2.2
    * Rename repoview into repoview.py
    * Rename __orphans__ to __nogroup__
    * Add a simple manpage
    * Check for repomd.xml before trying to parse it
